Gulp is used as the task runner and documentation regarding using gulp can be found at [Gulp's Website](https://gulpjs.com/).

The front end is built using [handlebars](http://handlebarsjs.com/), [SCSS](http://sass-lang.com/), (CSS Grid)[https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/grid], and uses [vanilla ES5 JavaScript](http://vanilla-js.com/).
